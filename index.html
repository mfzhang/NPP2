      N++2: Multi-threaded neural network simulator in C++. Simulates deep autoencoder networks with millions of weights as well as traditional multi-layer perceptrons with only a few hundred weights.
    </div>

    
      <p>N++2 is a multi-threaded neural network simulator for simulating large
neural networks with millions of weights. During the training procedure,
it makes heavy use of multi-core CPUs using several threads for propagating
multiple training patterns in parallel. Relying on CBLAS calls where 
appropriate, n++2 is also able to benefit of a CPU's SIMD-capabilities.</p>

<p>N++2 is able to speed-up training of "simple" multi-layer perceptrons with 
only one or two hidden layers and a few hundred connections. But it's main
purpose is to simulate huge neural networks with a number of hidden layers
and up to millions of weights in a "deep learning" setting. For this 
purpose, n++2 offers additional facilities for constructing symmetric 
autoencoder neural networks, easy layer-wise pre-training and for arranging
neurons in two-dimensional layers (helpful for processing images). Besides
fully connected layer types n++2 also comes with an implementation of sparse
connection structures, including receptive fields and shared-weights. Thus,
n++2 can also be used to simulate LeCun's convolutional neural networks and
to combine these sparse techniques with deep learning and layer-wise 
pretraining. </p>

<p>N++2 uses Martin Riedmiller's Resilient Propagation (RProp) for fast and 
reliable training of the neural networks. N++2 builds on Riedmiller's 
original (non-parallel) implementation n++ and uses mainly the same interface 
(API) to the "simulator core", although the internal structure of the neural 
networks in n++2 is different. On a dual quad-core CPU with two threads
per core (16 threads in parallel) n++2 is about 27 times faster than the
original n++.</p>
